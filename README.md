# Sequence-Retrieval-Biopython

Biopython is a powerful python library which provides a wide range of tools for working with bioinformatics. 

This python script is to demonstrate how to search for and retrieve sequence records from the NCBI database using Biopython. 

### Modules
1. *Entrez*: a molecular biology database system that provides access to NCBI databases.
2. *SeqIO* (Sequence Input/Output): reading and writing sequence files in various formats.
3. *Medline*: a bibliographic database maintained by the US National Library of Medicine (NLM).
